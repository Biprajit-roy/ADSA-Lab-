Q1.  Put them in Order:

First, used struct data type which Keeps function name and its calculated value together as it makes it easier to sort and print.
Test inputs i.e. a small set of n values to sample. For each n, weâ€™ll compute all functions and then sort them.
Array of function Stores all 12 functions with their names and computed values. Then used sorting( bubble sort is used) to compare the function values and swaps if out of order. Print the sorted order for this n.
