Initialize distances: All distances are set to infinity except the source.

Pick the minimum distance vertex: Select a vertex that has the smallest tentative distance and hasn’t been visited yet.

Update distances: Checks all the neighbors of this vertex and update their distances if a shorter path is found.

Repeat: Do this until all vertices are visited.

Prints result: Distances from the source to all vertices.
