LUP decomposition:

This program computes the decomposition

PA=LU

where

A is the input square matrix,

P is a permutation matrix (row swaps),

L is a lower triangular matrix (with 1s on the diagonal),

U is an upper triangular matrix.

This is basically Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting, rewritten in matrix form.
